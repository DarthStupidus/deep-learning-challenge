# deep-learning-challenge

Please find the coding for developing the model, and the word document contains the analysis and answers the questions asked for.

I have included several colab files - the orignal code had a batch size of 1 - and when I decided the best way to optimise the model, I then ran the optimised model with this batch size.

However, to run the code took a substantial period of time with this batch size - over an hour.  When iterating improvements I changed the batch size to 100 - to cut the run time down so a couple of minutes.  I have included the original code - with the batch size adjusted - and several iterations of the model to try and increase accuracy.  Once the optimisation was decided, I then ran the model again, reducing the batch size down to 1 - so we had a fair comparison.
